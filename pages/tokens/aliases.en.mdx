# Aliases

The nice thing about Tokens Studio for Figma is that you can reference other tokens as a value for your tokens (or ultimately, your styles). That means you can have your brand color be a reference to `colors.red.500`, or have a background token that takes its value from a `colors.black` token while a foreground token takes its value from a `colors.white` token.

To use an alias in your tokens, we write them in the following notation: `{spacing.sm}`, you can also write them in the older `$` notation, like this: `$spacing.sm`

You can also select any available alias while creating a token from the dropdown or by typing `{` and then typing a part of the alias name.

  References are case sensitive, that means you should write your references like your tokens are named (usually lowercase).
</Callout>

What this does is tell the plugin to go look for a token of `spacing.sm`, if it is found, use that value. Whenever you change `spacing.sm`, the token that referenced it also changes.

You can also embed aliases inside color tokens! If you want a color style that's using the brand color but reduce its opacity to 50% you could just write: `rgba({colors.brand}, 0.5)`
